# About Me
![Me](./me.png)
Hi! I'm Vincent Chov. Some of my friends call me Vince.

I'm a Software Engineer who graduated in 2017 from the University of
Connecticut (Storrs campus) with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, Computer
Science and Engineering.

I love animals and have a pet rabbit named Hoppy, who was born in April 2012. I
spend a little too much of my free time looking at pictures/GIFs/videos of cute
animals online.

I joined MakeHaven to have a more well-rounded skillset that will make me
handier around the house.  Most of my project ideas center around how I can
better take care of my pets in a cost-effective way, given that Hoppy is
getting older now.

Because so many of my project ideas are inspired by my pet bunny, I thought it
was fitting to call this website the "Foundations of Ferocious Bunnies".
There's a Monty Python joke in there somewhere.
