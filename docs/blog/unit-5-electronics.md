# Unit 5: Electronics
For the weeks of 2021-11-01 and 2021-11-08, we did Electronics week, where we covered the basics of soldering, using breadboards, and Arduino.

I am juggling multiple side projects and decided to keep it simple. I'd practice setting up Arduinos and more importantly, practicing my soldering skills.
