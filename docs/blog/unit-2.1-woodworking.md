# Unit 2.1: Woodworking
This week (2021-09-27) we started the first half of Unit 2, Woodworking.  There's so much equipment to learn about to get started with woodworking that we were asked to spend this week getting badged to use as much equipment as possible.  We didn't need to have any project ideas just yet, but if we were to have project ideas, we could prioritize learning about equipment that would work with those projects.

## Why did I get interested in Woodworking to begin with?
I got interested in woodworking for two main reasons: 
* to make beautiful, affordable, and practical knockdown/ready-to-assemble (RTA) furniture that I could pack flat and carry myself whenever I move from one apartment to another.  In making the furniture disassembable, I can replace parts as-needed if my pet rabbit Hoppy chews up parts of them.  I'd imagine that I'd have to worry less about him eating my table legs once I get better at metalworking, though.
* to make chew toys and furniture for Hoppy that I can know is safe (because I'd know what kind of wood was used)

## TL;DR: What I got badged on (in no particular order)
I got a head start on badging earlier this month, so the list of badges I got is much longer than it would have been had I only gotten badged this past week.  Here's the list, in no particular order of when I got them:
* Jointer
* Thickness Planer
* Tormek Blade Sharpener
* Hand Tools Badge
* Router Table
* Shapeoko CNC
* Table saw
* Band saw 
* Electric Hand Planer
* Belt/Spindle Sander
* Compound Miter Saw

## How I chose what to get badged on
I did some woodworking at home earlier this year, but ended-up spinning my wheels a lot as I tried to  compensate for both the high lumber prices (by reducing my reliance on S4S lumber), and the number of tools and jigs advertised on YouTube that I simply didn't have the budget nor the space for (I'm looking at you, jointer and planer).

Because I had some experience with some tools, I wanted to prioritize badging on tools that I either knew very little about, haven't used yet, and/or ones that could make tools and jigs that I already knew I wanted.

## How it went

Naturally, because I wanted to be able to square up boards and didn't have an arm and a [table] leg to spare for a jointer and thickness planer, I prioritized those. I still wanted to be able to prepare lumber at home (and avoid catching COVID), meaning I'd also have to find a way to save space.  That got me interested in hand planes since they're so common, a ton of them are really old and I remembered they were really cheap when I grew up.

I learned how to haggle but found out quickly that prices for hand planes (even beat-up vintage ones!) have been significantly inflated. I decided that if I couldn't find a large, affordable hand plane, I'd have to make a wooden one by scavenging parts off-of a cheaper, smaller plane. But to make a plane, I still needed to be able to joint and plane the parts first.  There was no way getting around it.

The Shapeoko CNC would be really useful for making router templates and shapes that I couldn't easily do myself.  In creating router templates, I could have a portable way of storing copies of things I wanted to make, in case I ever broke something. I'm still learning about the Shapeoko since it had issues when I badged on it and it has since been upgraded.

Once I got my hand on some templates, I'd be able to use them on a router and/or router table. I went with a router table since I haven't used one before.

Skipping forward, I got badged on the Wood Lathe, but I'm still gaining confidence here and knew nothing about the lathe before watching the badging video.  I'll definitely want more guidance and practice on this before I start using it on my own.

## Conclusion
All in all, I'm looking forward to getting more shop time with the new equipment.  There's a ton of projects I want to get done and not enough time to do them all, so we'll see what I'll make by next week.
