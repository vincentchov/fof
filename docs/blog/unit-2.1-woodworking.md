# Unit 2.1: Woodworking

For our first unit of the Foundations of Fabrication class at MakeHaven, we needed set up a documentation website and learn the basics of Inkscape to make a logo for the site. I decided to start with the logo since I'm fairly new to graphic design.

## Inkscape
Rabbits are my favorite animal, so I decided to make the website personalized to me by using a rabbit logo.

It quickly dawned on me that I wasn't going to be able (not easily anyway) to draw a vector logo of a rabbit using basic shapes. I wasn't sure what else I would want to use as a logo that would be specific to me.  After all, a lot of the things I'm learning how to make are intended to help me take care of my pet bunny, Hoppy.  I'd need some way to trace an existing image and/or convert it to a vector. If I'm going to trace an image, what's a better image than a photo of Hoppy?

At first, I thought that this was side-stepping the point of learning Inkscape, but then I remembered that the goal here wasn't specifically to draw shapes from scratch, but to use Inkscape in general. Moreover, the logo would be based on a photo that I took myself, so the tracing is original.

After watching some videos from "Logos by Nick" on YouTube, I went ahead and used GIMP to take a sketch I had of Hoppy and make everything but his silhouette transparent. That would make it a little easier for me to trace.  After a few minutes of using Inkscape's bezier curves to trace, I used "object to path" to vectorize the tracing the I made. I'd want to clean up the logo a bit and change the colors, but I'm pretty happy with this first attempt.

## Website
I decided on using VuePress to make the website, and that I'd host it on GitHub Pages, but due to some issues related to DNS, I decided to host the website on Netlify for now. Because of GitHub Pages' repo size limit, I'd have to keep the website under 1GB, but that's not a problem since I don't intend to host videos on the website.

As I accumulate more images, I'll need to host them somewhere else, like Flickr. Then again, you know what Homer Simpson said: "That's a problem for future [me]. Man I don't envy that guy." ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
