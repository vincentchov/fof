# Unit 3.2: Metalworking, or Welcome to the Machine (Shop)
On 2021-10-18, we did the second half of Unit 3, Metalworking. I decided to work on the frame for the stool since this was going to be a busy week. I'd have to cut corners and call it finished, no matter how janky the final product came out.

I wasn't able to attach the legs to the frame of the table, since I wanted to learn the basics of the waterjet to close the ends of the legs and tap them so the legs could be removable. I want to make the legs removable so the parts could be re-used when I design a better project. I decided to accept that I didn't know enough about the different tools to make that happen, so I didn't tack weld the legs on.
