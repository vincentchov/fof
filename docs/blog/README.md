# Introduction
This website will be a living document showing all the things I'm going to work
on while I take the "Foundations of Fabrication" course at
[MakeHaven](https://makehaven.org).  It's going to show my thought process,
solutions, including the things that ~~come back to haunt me~~ I need to change
to address new challenges in the course. Join in me in my journey to become a
more well-rounded maker.
